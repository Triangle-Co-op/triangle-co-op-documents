This project is a fork of https://github.com/dojo4/policy and much of the content here is based on
their amazing work. We are indebted to them for sharing their policy documents, which have made it
possible for us to more easily create our co-op.

For that reason, we leave their original words because we wish to operate in the same manner.

> It took us a while to get all our HR info in order and it continues to be a work in progress. It

> Please feel free to use in full or part. We hope it offers a helpful model.

> Looking forward to pull requests and contributions...

The content in the `WIP` directory is content from dojo4 that we have yet to implement, thus the
items in there are not a par tof our official policy yet.
