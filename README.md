# Triangle foundational, operations & policy documents

Triangle is a design & development co-op agency, with members based in Germany, Indonesia & Japan.

This is a collection of foundational, operations & policy documents of the co-op.

We are committed to operating in an open & fair manner, and thus we make these documents open so
others can understand how we work. As with all projects, we are adjusting and improving as we go.

We want to encourage others to create democratic businesses, the process of which can be unclear,
and therefore we want to offer these documents up for use to anyone who wants to form a co-op. In
fact, we have greatly relied on the work of others to create these documents.

## Foundational documents

These include:

-   bylaws
-   membership agreement

## Operations, agreements & policies

These are documents related to clients & third parties, such as contractors.

-   Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement
-   Contractor agreement

## Origins of documents content

The documents and their content primarily come from two sources:

-   This repository is a fork of https://github.com/dojo4/policy and much of the content here is
    based on their amazing work. We are indebted to them for sharing their policy documents, which
    have made it possible for us to more easily create our co-op.

-   Our original bylaws we wrote as a group come from the guidance & process of
    [start.coop](https://start.coop). We highly recommend following their documentation when
    starting out.

## Creating your own co-op

If you would like to create your own co-op, fork this repository and make it your own, but before
you do that, we recommend that you follow the [start.coop](https://start.coop) process, and maybe
join their accelerator if you can.

We have created community templates for Figma FigJam & Notion that follow the
[start.coop](https://start.coop) process and allow for easy group collaboration.

-   [Co-op creation process guide | Notion Template](https://www.notion.so/templates/co-op-creation-process-guide)

We hope it helps.

If you do create your own co-op, we wish you luck, and feel free to contact us if you need help.
